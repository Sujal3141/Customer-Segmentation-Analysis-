 							Customer Segmentation Analysis

Project Overview
 
Customer Segmentation Analysis is a data-driven project designed to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors and demographic information. By leveraging clustering algorithms, such as K-Means and DBSCAN, this project aims to identify patterns within the customer data that can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

Objectives

Identify distinct customer segments: Use clustering techniques to group customers based on various features such as Age, Spending score, Annual Income, and Gender.

Analyze customer behavior: Understand the characteristics of each segment to gain insights into different customer profiles.

Develop a predictive model: Build a model that can predict the segment a new customer belongs to based on their input features.

Deploy the model: Create a Flask-based web application that allows users to input customer data and receive a segmentation prediction in real-time.
