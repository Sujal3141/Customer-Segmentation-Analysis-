# Customer Segmentation Analysis




## Project Overview

Customer Segmentation Analysis is a data-driven project designed to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors and demographic information. By leveraging K- Means clustering algorithm , this project aims to identify patterns within the customer data that can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

## Objectives

○  Identify distinct customer segments: Use clustering techniques to group customers based on various features such as age, income, spending habits, and gender.

○ Analyze customer behavior: Understand the characteristics of each segment to gain insights into different customer profiles.

○ Develop a predictive model: Build a model that can predict the segment a new customer belongs to based on their input features.

○ Deploy the model: Create a Flask-based web application that allows users to input customer data and receive a segmentation prediction in real-time.

## Key Features
⦿ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing features.

⦿Clustering Analysis: Implementing K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms to identify customer segments.

⦿Dimensionality Reduction: Using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to visualize high-dimensional data in a 2D or 3D space.

⦿Outlier Detection: Identifying and removing outliers to improve the accuracy of the clustering.

⦿Web Application: A Flask application that allows users to input customer data and view the predicted customer segment.

⦿Visualization: Interactive plots and graphs to visualize the clusters and customer profiles.
